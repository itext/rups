RUPS
====

iText RUPS is a tool to view PDF structure in a Swing GUI.

### Building and running

iText Rups is built into a Jar file which is then run by Java. To build iText Rups with Maven, run the following command:
```
mvn clean package
```

The resultant Jar file with dependencies will be located in the `target` directory.

To run RUPS, simply type

```
java -jar itext-rups-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

##### Creating an executable file on Windows

If you are a Windows user, there is a possibility to create a RUPS executable (`exe` file). It still requires Java Runtime Environment to run, but you will not need to type the command anymore each time.

To build an executable, run the following command:

```
mvn clean package -P exe
```

This should produce `Rups.exe` in your `target` folder which you can run as any other executable assuming you have Java installed on your system.

##### Creating an application bundle (.app) on macOS

Similar to Windows executable, there is a possibility to create a RUPS application bundle (`.app` application) for macOS. Again, it requires Java Runtime Environment to run. Proper application bundle can only be built on macOS.

To create application bundle, run the following command:

```
mvn clean package -P mac
```

This will produce `RUPS.app` in your `target` folder. You can copy it to your 'Applications' folder and run it as any other application assuming you have Java installed on your system.

##### Troubleshooting

-- Error running mvn clean package...

mvn clean package
[ERROR] Error executing Maven.
[ERROR] java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to load cache item
[ERROR] Caused by: Unable to load cache item
[ERROR] Caused by: Could not initialize class com.google.inject.internal.cglib.core.$MethodWrapper

This may be caused by using an unsupported version of java. Try downgrading or upgrading your java version as appropriate.

-- Error generating javadocs

[ERROR] MavenReportException: Error while generating Javadoc: Unable to find javadoc command: The environment variable JAVA_HOME is not correctly set.
org.apache.maven.reporting.MavenReportException: Unable to find javadoc command: The environment variable JAVA_HOME is not correctly set.

Make sure to define your JAVA_HOME pointing to your jdk installation folder. Or make sure that javadoc is on your command path.

-- Warnings downloading package-lists

[WARNING] Error fetching link: http://dom4j.github.io/apidocs/package-list. Ignored it

Some package lists may be unavailable (404 error). This will not cause the build to fail so can be ignored.
